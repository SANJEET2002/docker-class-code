Docker Volumes 

Docker Volumes Demo (Bind Mounts)

This small demo shows how to run a Node.js container using the latest node:latest image and mount a local directory into the container using Docker bind mounts.

We will start the container with an interactive bash shell to see the mounted files inside the container.

📘 What Are Docker Volumes?

Docker volumes are storage mechanisms used by containers to persist data beyond the container’s lifecycle.
They allow data to be stored outside the container filesystem so it isn’t lost when the container is stopped, removed, or recreated.

There are two main types:

Managed volumes (created by Docker)

Bind mounts (map host directories to containers)

This demo uses bind mounts.

📁 1. Prerequisites

Docker installed

Any directory on your system containing files (for demo)

Example: ./app

app/
  index.js
  package.json

🚀 2. Run Container With Bind Mount

Run the following command from the directory above your app folder:

docker run -it \
  -v $(pwd)/app:/usr/src/app \
  -w /usr/src/app \
  node:latest bash

Explanation
Flag	Meaning
-it	Interactive terminal
-v	Mount a local directory into container
-w	Set working directory inside container
node:latest	Base image
bash	Start bash shell
📦 3. Validate the Volume Mount

Inside container, list files:

ls -al


You should see the same files from your local app/ directory.

🧪 4. (Optional) Run Node Script

If you have a package.json, install dependencies:

npm install


Run your app:

node index.js

🛑 5. Stop and Exit

To exit container:

exit


The container will stop and your local files remain unchanged.

📝 Notes

This is a bind mount, meaning changes are synced between host and container in real time.

Useful for local development without rebuilding images.

You can edit files locally and re-run commands inside container instantly.

🔧 Windows Users

Use this format instead of $(pwd):

docker run -it ^
  -v "%cd%/app:/usr/src/app" ^
  -w /usr/src/app" ^
  node:latest bash

🎉 Conclusion

You have successfully run a Node container and mounted a local folder into it using Docker.
This allows you to develop locally while running code inside containers.
